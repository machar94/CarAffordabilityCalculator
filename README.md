To Do

- [ ] Make a good README.md
- [ ] Add to projects on GitHub

## Description

This projects showcases a simple car affordability calculator written in python which compares the monthly ownership cost of two cars. The following factors are considered:

* fuel: local gas price, typical miles driven, fuel economy
* maintenance: 1-5 year expenses, 6-10 year expenses
* loan: down payment, interest rate / credit score, term length

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to practice coding in Python (creating a simple terminal app, reading from a csv, calling a public api with `requests` library.)

Many assumptions were made about the details required to calculate cost. Check out the [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utJqFRnQvSuk0oZsS2ZkfwA_Ksngy38YX5G5fBaCU-s/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.
